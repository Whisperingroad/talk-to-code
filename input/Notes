case 1 - for eg x is smaller, bigger, equal, not equal
case 2 - for eg x is greater, more, less


Step 1 -- finding main subject

word2 of the first relation with nsubj will be the main subject
word1 of the first nsubj may be the second value (case 2) // store second value
however, more of than not, it will be an adjective (case 1) //store condition

Step 1i -- Checking if main subject is just a number describing the actual main subject, eg. 5x
Just look for nummod relation

an if condition will always start with a noun, if this noun is a cardinal number, I should check if it is describing another subject, for instance, 5 x
if it is, join them together, otherwise just treat the subject as it is

Step 2 -- Looking for condition

once a subject is found, look for a condition, aka adjectives
if an nsubj relation is found and the main subject is word2 and word1 is an adjective, word1 is a condition (case 1) // store condition
if word1 is another noun, it is a second subject
in this event, the condition will be word2 of an advmod relation, with word1 being the second subject  (case 2) // store second subject

In order to verify if a given condition is associated with a subject
for case 1, look out for advmod relations, word1 second subject, word2 condition
for case 2, look out for nmod:than and nmod:to, word1 condition, word2 second subject
